	<p><b>Do you store my credit card details?</b></p>
    No.
    
    <p><b>How secure is this app?</b></p>
    We could answer that with details that would make you scratch your head but then we'd be compromising your security by disclosing details on how we manage data security, and you wouldn't want that now, would you? Yes, that's what we thought too.
    
    <p><b>What payment processor do you use?</b></p>
    We use Stripe, because it's awesome. If you want to read more about how Stripe manages security, and the other ways they're disrupting online payments, visit them at www.stripe.com.
    
    <p><b>What payment methods do you accept?</b></p>
    Visa, Mastercard, AmericanExpress.
