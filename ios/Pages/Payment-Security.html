	<p><b>Do you store my credit card details?</b></p>
    No.
    
    <p><b>How secure is this app?</b></p>
    Security is serious business. That's why we work with Stripe (www.stripe.com) for managing all payments in app. For the geek in you, know that Stripe is:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>PCI compliant</li> What does this mean? It means that Stripe has been audited by a PCI certified auditor, and is certified tp PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of certification available.<br><br>
        <li>SSL and HSTS enriched</li>Stripe forces HTTPS for all services. If you don't know what HSTS means.. you're not the only one!<br><br>
        <li>Encrypted</li>All card numbers are encrypted on disk with AES-256. Decryption keys are stored on separate machines. None of Stripe's internal servers and daemons are able to obtain plaintext card numbers; instead, they can just request that cards be sent to a service provider on a static whitelist. This is a good thing.<br>
    
    <p><b>What payment processor do you use?</b></p>
    We use Stripe (www.stripe.com). Why? Because they're the most secure payment gateway available. They're wildly successful (in the same league as PayPal, in fact one of the investors in Stripe is Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal). And last but not least: they're awesome.
    
    <p><b>What payment methods do you accept?</b></p>
    Visa, Mastercard, AmericanExpress.
