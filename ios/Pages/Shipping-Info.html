        <p><b>I just ordered a dress. How long will it take to reach me?</b></p>
    
        In most cases, 10-12 days. In exceptionally (good) cases, 3-5 days. Need it sooner? Call us and we’ll zoom it through (no promises, but we’ll try our very best).
        
        <p><b>Why 10-12 days for delivery?</b></p>
        This is how it becomes 10-12 days:<br>
        <i>First</i>, the seller sends us the dress. Royal Mail, standard delivery, 3-5 days.<br>
        <i>Second</i>, we check the dress, that’s 1 day.<br>
        <i>Third</i>, we ship the dress freshly cleaned and square-boxed to you. Royal Mail, standard delivery, 3-5 days again.
        So 3-5 + 1 + 3-5 = 10-12. In the future this will be much lower.
    
        <p><b>What happens if I’m out when my purchase is delivered?</b></p>
        Royal Mail will deliver it anyway.
        
        <p><b>What happens if I change my mind while my purchase is in transit?</b></p>
        Then you would have changed your mind while the goods are still in transit, right? Once goods have shipped, not much we can do. You still have 7 days to return the item, so that’s probably the best option to pursue in this situation.
        
        <p><b>How do you ensure all your items are genuine?</b></p>
        We check them, piece by piece. In our offices in Shoreditch. Unless the item is brand new, in which case the selling store will ship it directly to you (the buyer).
        
        <p><b>What address will you send my dress to?</b></p>
        We ship items to the address you list in My Profile section. 
        
        <p><b>I live in the UK, will you deliver to me?</b></p>
        Yes.
        
        <p><b>I live outside the UK will you deliver to me?</b></p>
        Yes and No. We deliver anywhere in the European Union. Why? Because it’s a good place to start ☺ We’re looking at worldwide shipping too, soon.
        
        <p><b>What countries are in the EU, you ask?</b></p>
        Good question! It’s: Germany, Great Britain, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Sweden, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Czech Republic, Hungary, Cyprus (South Cyprus only - apparently).
        
        <p><b>How much does shipping cost?</b></p>
        GBP 5 for UK, and GBP 15 for all other countries.
