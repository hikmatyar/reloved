        <p><b>I just placed an order. How long will it take to reach me?</b></p>
        In most cases, 10-12 days, and in exceptionally good cases, 3-5 days.
        
        <p><b>How do you ensure all your items are high quality?</b></p>
        We check them, piece by piece, which is a long and arduous process. For every item we select/purchase, we reject 100 more. Only once we are fully convinced of the quality, we buy the item. Every item we sell is already with us, and stored in our offices in London.
        
        <p><b>I live in the UK, will you deliver to me?</b></p>
        Yes.
        
        <p><b>I live outside the UK will you deliver to me?</b></p>
        Yes, we ship internationally.
        
        <p><b>How much does shipping cost?</b></p>
        GBP 6 for UK, and GBP 15 for all other countries.
