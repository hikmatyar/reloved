        <p><b>I just ordered a dress. How long will it take to reach me?</b></p>
    
        In most cases, 10-12 days. In exceptionally (good) cases, 3-5 days. 
        
        <p><b>Why 10-12 days for delivery?</b></p>
        This is how it becomes 10-12 days:<br>
        <i>First</i>, the seller sends us the dress. Royal Mail, standard delivery, 3-5 days.<br>
        <i>Second</i>, we check the dress, that’s 1 day.<br>
        <i>Third</i>, we ship the dress freshly cleaned and square-boxed to you. Royal Mail, standard delivery, 3-5 days again.
        So 3-5 + 1 + 3-5 = 10-12. In the future this will be much lower.
    
        <p><b>What happens if I’m out when my purchase is delivered?</b></p>
        Royal Mail will deliver it anyway.
        
        <p><b>What happens if I change my mind while my purchase is in transit?</b></p>
        Then you would have changed your mind while the goods are still in transit, right? Once goods have shipped, not much we can do. You still have 7 days to return the item, so that’s probably the best option to pursue in this situation.
        
        <p><b>How do you ensure all your items are genuine?</b></p>
        We check them, piece by piece.
        
        <p><b>What address will you send my dress to?</b></p>
