        <b>FOR BUYERS</b>
        <p><b>Do you offer returns?</b></p>
        Yes. 7 days on everything.
        
        <p><b>7 days?</b></p>
        Yes, 7 days from the date you receive it, to the date you put it in the mail to return.
        
        <p><b>How do I return an item?</b></p>
        Email us at <a href="mailto:hello@relovedapp.co.uk">
            hello@relovedapp.co.uk</a>.
        After we receive your email we will send you a return note that you need to print and include with your return package.
        
        <p><b>Who pays for return shipping?</b></p>
        The buyer does.
        
        <p><b>What happens after I’ve returned an item?</b></p>
        <ul><li>We check the item. Is it clean? Is it as it was when we sent it to you? If all good - then we move on to;</li>
            <li>We put a note in to our bank asking them to refund you, and then</li>
            <li>Within 10-15 days of the return, money’s back on your card. Minus our quality assurance fee, which is £6.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>I just ordered a dress. How long will it take to reach me?</b></p>
        
        In most cases, 10-12 days. In exceptionally (good) cases, 3-5 days.
        
        <p><b>Why 10-12 days for delivery?</b></p>
        This is how it becomes 10-12 days:<br>
        <i>First</i>, the seller sends us the dress. Royal Mail, standard delivery, 3-5 days.<br>
        <i>Second</i>, we check the dress, that’s 1 day.<br>
        <i>Third</i>, we ship the dress freshly cleaned and square-boxed to you. Royal Mail, standard delivery, 3-5 days again.
        So 3-5 + 1 + 3-5 = 10-12. In the future this will be much lower.
        
        <p><b>How do you ensure all your items are genuine?</b></p>
        We check them, piece by piece.
        
        <p><b>What address will you send my dress to?</b></p>
        We ship items to the address you list in My Profile section.
        
        <p><b>I live in the UK, will you deliver to me?</b></p>
        Yes.
        
        <p><b>I live outside the UK will you deliver to me?</b></p>
        We deliver anywhere in the European Union.
        
        <p><b>What countries are in the European Union?</b></p>
        Germany, Great Britain, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Sweden, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Czech Republic, Hungary, Cyprus (South Cyprus only).
