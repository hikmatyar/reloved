        We check the item, and assuming it's ok, we will proceed to issue a refund to you.

        In most cases, 10-12 days, and in exceptionally good cases, 3-5 days.
        
        <p><b>How do you ensure all your items are high quality?</b></p>
        We check them, piece by piece, which is a long and arduous process. For every item we select/purchase, we reject 100 more, and each item takes on average 3 hours to find (we work with artisans in remote parts of the world, which is how we are able to source unique products that aren't available on the high streets in London and New York. Only once we are fully convinced of the quality, we buy the item. Every item we sell is already with us, and stored in our offices in London.
